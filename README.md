# algorithms
My task was to implement Dijkstra's algoritm, what I successfully did!
Input data:
  First line — 2 numbers: number of successive lines and name of start vertex
  Following lines — each has 3 numbers: name of vertex, name of adjacent vertex and, of course, weight of edge
 Output:
  Average distance to each vertex from start vertex
  
 P.S. Vertex in my graph means node :)
