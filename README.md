# algorithms
My task was to:
  1. Implement merge sort algorithm
  2. Measure elapsed time between algorithm's start and finish
  3. Count comparisons made by algo
  4. Add tests

To start program:
  1. Download or clone repo
  2. Make sure you have python 3
  3. Open folder of the project with terminal and type in terminal command "python3 main.py asc 1,5,4,7,67,-300,45", instead of numbers from example type your own and also you can replace asc with desc for descending sort
  
 To run tests:
  1. Type "python3 -m unittest test_merge_sort.py" in terminal being in project folder
